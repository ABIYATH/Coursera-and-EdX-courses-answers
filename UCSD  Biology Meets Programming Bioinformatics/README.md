#### Instructors: Pavel Pevzner and Phillip E. C. Compeau

This course will cover algorithms for solving various biological problems along with a handful of programming challenges helping you implement these algorithms in Python. It offers a gently-paced introduction to our Bioinformatics Specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics), preparing learners to take the first course in the Specialization, "Finding Hidden Messages in DNA" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis).

Each of the four weeks in the course will consist of an interactive textbook provides Python programming challenges that arise from real biological problems.
